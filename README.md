# CS371p: Object-Oriented Programming Allocator Repo

This is a project to build an efficient memory allocator. The main file is "Allocator.hpp" and there is an example of sample input and output in RunAllocator.in and RunAllocator.out. For reference, on the input, positive numbers within a given test case mean to allocate a block of that size in the first available location, and negative numbers (-n) mean to deallocate the nth allocated block. The output is a representation of allocated (negative numbers) and unallocated (positive numbers) blocks by their size. Hopefully that all makes sense.
